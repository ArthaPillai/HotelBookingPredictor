# HotelBooking_PredictiveModeling

Welcome to this project on building predictive models to identify the factors involved in booking and cancellation of hotel reservations by the customers. In this project, we will be using classification, inference, and regression models to analyze and predict different factors involved in hotel reservation booking and cancellation.

##Project Overview
The dataset we will be using is pretty exploratory for Data Analysis and building predictive models. We will be using descriptive analytics to identify relationships, trends, and abnormalities in data. Our goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a customer canceling a hotel reservation and also identify the factors that are likely to lead to a booking or a cancellation.

##Dataset
The dataset we will be using for this project is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information on hotel bookings made by customers, including their demographics, booking information, and other factors. The dataset has over 100,000 observations and contains a mix of categorical and numerical variables.

##Tools and Technologies
We will be using Python and several Python libraries for data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling. Some of the libraries we will be using include NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

##Project Deliverables
The following deliverables are expected from this project:

A comprehensive data analysis report that describes the trends, relationships, and abnormalities identified in the dataset.
A predictive model that can accurately predict the likelihood of a customer canceling a hotel reservation.
An identification of the factors that are likely to lead to a booking or a cancellation.

##Conclusion
This project is aimed at building a predictive model that can help hotels and other businesses in the hospitality industry to understand the factors that lead to hotel reservation booking and cancellation. The insights gained from this project will be valuable for businesses to improve their customer service and optimize their revenue.
